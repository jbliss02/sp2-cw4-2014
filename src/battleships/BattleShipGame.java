 *The BattleshipGame class is the main class — that is, it contains a main method. In
	this class you will set up the game; accept shots from the user; display the results; print
	final scores; and ask the user if s/he wants to play again.
	
	All input/output is done here (although some of it is done by calling a print()
	method in the Ocean class.) All computation will be done in the Ocean class and the
	various Ship classes.
